The application was created using the React library. 
Styling is done with module.css / styled/mui. 
Also libraries such as - swiper / notiflix were used. 

Implemented backend on Node.js/ Express.


The application is an implementation of the choice of ideas. 
Once an idea has been selected on the Ideas page, you can confirm the implementation of the previously selected idea on the Home page. 
After that, the card will disappear from the list, but the information about the idea you implemented will remain on the Achievements and Completed pages. 
On the Achievements page, there will be a list of ideas and the number of completions. 
On the Completed page, there is a table that will contain information about the topic of the idea, the idea itself and the date of its implementation. 

Enjoy using!
